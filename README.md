# Edge Manageability Framework

## Primary Product: Edge Orchestrator
At the center of Edge Manageability Framework is Edge Orchestrator, the primary solution to manage edge environments efficiently and securely. It encompasses a range of features that cater to the unique demands of edge computing, ensuring seamless integration and operation across diverse hardware and software landscapes. Edge Orchestrator is designed to be the central hub for managing edge infrastructure and edge application deployments at scale across geographically distributed edge sites.  It offers automated application deployment based on customer-defined configuration & criteria, multitenancy and identity & access management for tenants, observability & alerting capabilities, dashboards for quick views of status & issue identification, and management of all software deployments & infrastructure components including edge nodes (i.e. hosts) and clusters.

Welcome to the Edge Manageability Framework, a comprehensive solution designed
to streamline and enhance the deployment and management of infrastructure and
applications at the edge. This framework leverages cutting-edge technologies to
provide robust solutions for hardware onboarding, secure workload deployment,
and cluster lifecycle management, all centered around Kubernetes-based
application deployment for edge computing.

### Key Components and Repositories

Edge Orchestrator is used to centrally manage all Edge Nodes at sites and perform all lifecycle management of OS, clusters, and applications in the managed nodes. Edge Orchestrator consists of six main components, and it is deployable on-premises or in the cloud:

- [Edge Infrastructure Manager](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-manage-docs/main/developer_guide/infra_manager/index.html): Policy-based secure life cycle management of a fleet of edge nodes/devices at scale, spread across distributed locations allowing onboarding, provisioning, inventory management, upgrades and more.
- [Edge Cluster Orchestrator](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-manage-docs/main/developer_guide/cluster_orch/index.html): A lightweight orchestrator based on the Cluster API (CAPI) standard designed to automate the deployment and lifecycle management of Kubernetes* clusters at scale across distributed edges, providing centralized monitoring and access control.
- [Edge Application Orchestrator](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-manage-docs/main/developer_guide/app_orch/index.html): Offers customers the ability to easily package, deploy and monitor cloud-native applications at scale across distributed edges
- [UI](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/orch-ui): The web user interface for the Edge Orchestrator, allowing the user to manage most of the features of the product in an intuitive, visual, manner without having to trigger a series of APIs individually.
- [Observability](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-manage-docs/main/developer_guide/observability/index.html): A modular observability stack that provides visibility into the health and performance of the system, including logging, reporting, alerts, and SRE data from Edge Orchestrator components and Edge Nodes.
