# Edge Manageability Framework

## Primary Product: Edge Orchestrator
At the center of Edge Manageability Framework is Edge Orchestrator, the primary solution to manage edge environments efficiently and securely. It encompasses a range of features that cater to the unique demands of edge computing, ensuring seamless integration and operation across diverse hardware and software landscapes. Edge Orchestrator is designed to be the central hub for managing edge infrastructure and edge application deployments at scale across geographically distributed edge sites.  It offers multitenancy and IDAM for tenants and offers automation, configuration, observability and alerting capabilities, dashboards for quick views of status and issue identification, and management of all infrastructure components including edge nodes (i.e. hosts) and clusters.

Welcome to the Edge Manageability Framework, a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and enhance the deployment and management of infrastructure and applications at the edge. This framework leverages cutting-edge technologies to provide robust solutions for hardware onboarding, secure workload deployment, and cluster lifecycle management, all centered around Kubernetes-based application deployment for edge computing.
