# Design Proposal: Scenario-Specific Northbound APIs and CLI Commands for EIM Decomposition

Author(s) Edge Infrastructure Manager Team

Last updated: 18/12/25

## Abstract

In the context of EIM decomposition, the North Bound API service should be treated as an
independent interchangeable module.
The [EIM proposal for modular decomposition](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-manageability-framework/blob/main/design-proposals/eim-modular-decomposition.md)
calls out a need for exposing both a full set of EIM APIs, and a need for exposing only a subset of EIM API
as required by individual workflows taking advantage of a modular architecture.
This proposal explores how the exposed APIs can be decomposed
and adjusted to reflect only the supported EIM services per particular scenario.
It defines how different scenarios can be supported by API versions that match only the services
and features required per scenario, while keeping the full API support in place.

## Background and Context

There are multiple levels of APIs currently available within EMF, with individual specs available for
each domain in
[orch-utils](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/orch-utils/tree/main/tenancy-api-mapping/openapispecs/generated).

The list of domain APIs includes:

- Catalog and Catalog utilities APIs
- App deployment manager and app resource manager APIs
- Cluster APIs
- EIM APIs
- Alert Monitoring APIs
- MPS and RPS APIs
- Metadata broker and Tenancy APIs

There are two levels to the API decomposition:

- **Cross-domain decomposition**: Separation of the above domain-level APIs
(e.g., only exposing EIM APIs - without Cluster APIs, App Orchestrator APIs and others).
- **Intra-domain decomposition**: Separation within a domain (e.g., at the EIM domain level,
where the overall set of APIs may include onboarding/provisioning/Day 2 APIs,
but another workflow may support only onboarding/provisioning without Day 2 support).

The following questions must be answered and investigated:

- How is the API service built currently?
  - It is built from a proto definition and code is autogenerated by the "buf" tool -
  [See How NB API is Currently Built](#how-nb-api-is-currently-built)
- How is the API service container image built currently?
- How are the API service Helm charts built currently?
- What level of decomposition is needed for the required workflows?
- How to decompose APIs at the domain level?
  - At the domain level, the APIs are deployed as separate services
- How to decompose APIs within the domain level?
- How to build various API service versions as per desired workflows using the modular APIs?
- How to deliver the various API service versions as per desired workflows?
- How to expose the list of available APIs for client consumption (orch-cli)?

### Scenarios to be Supported by the Initial Decomposition

Currently planned decomposition tasks is focused on the EIM layer. The following is the list of deployment scenarios:

- **Full EMF** - Full EMF including all existing levels of APIs.
- **EIM Only** - EIM installed on its own, includes only the existing EIM APIs.
- **EIM vPRO Only** - EIM installed on its own, including only the EIM APIs required to support vPRO use cases.

### About EIM API (apiv2)

In Edge Infratructure Manager (EIM) the apiv2 service represents the North Bound API service that exposes
the EIM operations to the end user, who uses Web UI, Orch-CLI or direct API calls. Currently,
the end user is not allowed to call the EIM APIs directly. The API calls reach first the API gateway, external
to EIM (Traefik gateway), they are mapped to EIM internal API endpoints and passed to EIM.

**Note**: The current mapping of external APIs to internal APIs is 1:1, with no direct mapping to SB APIs. The mapping is going to be removed so user can call internal APIs directly.
The API service communicates with Inventory via gRPC, which then manages the SB API interactions.

**Apiv2** is just one of EIM Resource Managers that talk to one EIM internal component - the Inventory - over gRPC.
Similar to other RMs, it updates status of the Inventory resources and retrieves their status allowing user
performing operations on the EIM resources for manipulating Edge Nodes.
In EMF 2025.2, the apiv2 service is deployed via a helm chart deployed by Argo CD as one of its applications.
The apiv2 service is run and deployed in a container kick-started from the apiv2 service container image.

#### How NB API is Currently Built

Currently, apiv2 (infra-core repository) holds the definition of REST API services in protocol buffer files
(.proto) and uses protoc-gen-connect-openapi to autogenerate the OpenAPI spec - openapi.yaml.

The input to protoc-gen-connect-openapi comes from:

- `api/proto/services` directory - one file (services.proto) containing API operations on
all the available resources (Service Layer).
- `api/proto/resources` directory - multiple files with data models - separate file with data
model per single inventory resource.

Protoc-gen-connect-openapi is the tool that is indirectly used to build the openapi spec.
It is configured as a plugin within buf (buf.gen.yaml).

#### About Buf

Buf is a replacement for protoc (the standard Protocol Buffers compiler). It makes working with
.proto files easier as it replaces messy protoc commands with clean config file.
It is a all-in-one tool as it provides compiling, linting, breaking change detection, and dependency management.

In infra-core/apiv2, **buf generate** command is executed within the **make generate** or
**make buf-gen** target to generate the OpenAPI 3.0 spec directly from .proto files in api/proto/ directory.

Protoc-gen-connect-openapi plugin takes as an input one full openapi spec that includes all services
(services.proto) and outputs the openapi spec in api/openapi.

Key Items:

- Input: api/proto/**/*.proto
- Config: buf.gen.yaml, buf.work.yaml, buf.yaml
- Output: openapi.yaml
- Tool: protoc-gen-connect-openapi

Based on the content of api/proto/ , buf also generates:

- The Go code ( Go structs, gRPC clients/services) in internal/pbapi.
- gRPC gateway: REST to gRPC proxy code - HTTP handlers that proxy REST calls to gRPC (in internal/pbapi/**/*.pb.gw.go).
- Documentation: docs/proto.md.

## Decomposing the API service

An investigation needs to be conducted into how the API service can be decomposed to be rebuilt as various
flavors of the same API service providing different sets of APIs.

**Design Principles:**

1. **Single Source of Truth**: The total set of APIs serves as the main source of the API service,
and other  API subsets are automatically derived from this based on required functionality.
This makes maintenance simple and centralized.

2. **Domain-Level Decomposition**: The API service should be decomposed at the domain level,
meaning that all domains or a subset of domains should be available as part of the EMF.
   - At this level, APIs are already decomposed/modular and deployed as separate services
   (e.g., EIM APIs, Cluster APIs, App Orchestrator APIs).
   - **For EIM-focused scenarios**: Only the EIM domain APIs would be included.

3. **Intra-Domain Decomposition**: The API service should be decomposed within the domain level, meaning
that only a subset of available APIs may need to be released and/or exposed at the API service level.
   - **Example**: Within the EIM domain, we may not want to expose Day 2 functionality for some workflows,
   even though Day 2 operations are part of the full EIM OpenAPI spec.
   - This allows workflows focused on onboarding/provisioning to omit upgrade, maintenance, and troubleshooting APIs.

4. **Resource-Level Decomposition**: The API service may also need to be decomposed at the individual internal service level.
   - **Example**: Host resource might need different data models across use cases.
   - **Note**: This would require separate data models and may increase complexity significantly.

The following are the investigated options to decomposing or exposing subsets of APIs.

- ~~API Gateway that would only expose certain endpoints to user~~ -
it does not actually solve the problem of releasing only specific flavours of EMF.
- ~~Maintain multiple OpenAPI specification~~ - while possible to create multiple OpenAPI specs,
the maintenance of same APIs across specs will be a large burden.
- ~~Authentication & Authorization Based Filtering~~ - we do not control the
end users of the EMF, and we want to provide tailored modular product for each workflow.
- ~~API Versioning strategy~~ - creating different API versions for each use-case means too much overhead,
 similar to maintaining multiple OpenAPI specs.
- ~~Proxy/Middleware Layer~~ - similar to API Gateway, does not fit our use cases.
- ~~OpenAPI Spec Manipulation~~ - This approach uses OpenAPI's extension mechanism (properties starting with x-)
to add metadata that describes which audiences, use cases, or clients should have access to specific endpoints,
operations, or schemas. This approach is worth investigating to see if it can give us the automated approach for
creating individual OpenAPI specs for workflows based on labels. - not valid as it was decided that the openapi
spec will be always generated for the full EI API set only.
- ~~Break the protobu definition file `service.proto` into mupliple files~~ - one per service,
and use buf to select services based on scenario manifest. It would generare scenario specific apispec - not valid as it was decided that the openapi
spec will be always generated for the full EI API set only.
- Keep the openapi as it is - supporting all the full EIM APIs. Enable only the gRPC API services expected to be supported per scenario. - selected approach.

### Proposal 

#### Build and release of the decomposed API service a module

Build the EIM API Service per Scenario

- There is no change to the protobuf definitions in `apiv2/proto`
- There is no change to the code generated for the probuf definitions:
  - openapi spec -`openapi.yaml` will still contain all the EIM API services.
  - the generated go code will support all the EIM API services.
- Scenario manifests will define the API service subsets supported per the scenario.
- as part of make `generate` target, the manifests will be parsed to generate go code mappings between the scenarios names and required API services.
- the apiv2 application will receive an argument `scenario` holding the name of the chosen EIM scenario. The argument will be provided by the Helm chart value `scenario`.

Recommended Release Approach:

- Build and release a single apiv2 container image that will support all scenarios.
- Single Helm chart for all scenarios will use a specific value to set additional apiv2 flag to choose scenario.
- Argo profiles can specify different scenarios - depending on the profiles enabled (e.g., `orch-configs/profiles/eim-only-vpro.yaml`
it sets `eimScenario: vpro`)


#### Define Scenario Manifests

Maintain scenario manifests that list the API services supported by each scenario.
Scenario manifest files will be kept in `infra-core/apiv2`. The following are the examples of the manifests:

```yaml
   # manifests/fulleim.yaml
   name: fulleim
   description: All EIM services
   services:
   - HostService
   - InstanceService
   - OSUpdateRunService
   (..)

   # manifests/vpro.yaml
   name: vpro
   description: EIM vPRO only
   services:
   - host
```

**Why manifest files:**

- The manifest files act as a configuration to be used by the apiv2 application.
- The manifests are used to determine which gRPC services to enable in apiv2.
- The manifests can be easily located and updated by a person not familiar with the code.
- The list of services can be validated against service handlers generated by buf based on the proto definitions.
- Version controlled in git repository.

#### Modify REST-gRPC gateway Implementation

The apiv2 proxy server (`internal/proxy\server.go`) for translating the REST calls to gRPC requests will register only the handlers related to the API services to be supported by configured scenario.

#### Modify gRPC Server implementation.

The apiv2 gRPC server for will register only the gRPC service handlers related to the API services to be supported by configured scenario.

## Consuming the Scenario Specific APIs from the CLI

### Proposal

EMF will provide a service that communicates which endpoints/APIs are
currently supported by the deployed API service - Component Status Service.
Proposed in [Design Proposal: Orchestrator Component Status Service](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-manageability-framework/blob/main/design-proposals/platform-component-status-service.md).
Development of such service is outside of this ADR's scope.

#### CLI Workflow

1. **Build**: CLI is built based on the full REST API spec.
2. **Capability Discovery on Login**: The CLI queries the new capabilities service endpoint, upon user login,
to request API capability information.
3. **Configuration Caching**: The CLI saves the supported API configuration locally.
4. **Command Validation**: Before executing commands, the CLI checks the cached configuration and executes
only the commands supported by the currently deployed scenario.
5. **Error Handling**:
   - For CLI commands: Display user-friendly error message.
   - For direct curl calls: API returns HTTP 404 (endpoint not found).

#### CLI Login Command Flow

```bash
   ┌─────────────────┐
   │ User runs       │
   │ orch-cli login  │
   └────────┬────────┘
            │
            ▼
   ┌─────────────────────────┐
   │ GET /../capabilities│  ← Example of the new service endpoint
   └────────┬────────────────┘
            │
            ▼
   ┌──────────────────────────┐
   │ Response:                │
   │ {                        │
   │   "scenario": "eim-vpro",│
   │   "apis": [            ← Example of the new service responce
   │     "onboarding",        │
   │     "provisioning"       │
   │   ]                      │
   │ }                        │
   └────────┬─────────────────┘
            │
            ▼
   ┌─────────────────────────┐
   │ CLI caches config       │
   │ in ~/.orch-cli/config   │
   └─────────────────────────┘
   ```

## Summary of Action Items

### 1. Traefik Gateway Compatibility

- Traefik gateway will be removed for all workflows. NB API calls will access EIM enpoints directly.
- CLI client will be bult based on the full REST API spec provided by apiv2 (previously provided by orch-utils).

### 2. Scenario Definition and API Mapping

- Define all supported scenarios:
  - Full EIM
  - EIM vPRO
  - Full EIM without observability
- For each scenario, document:
  - Required services (which resource managers are needed)
  - Required API endpoints (which operations are exposed)
  - Deployment configuration (Helm values, profiles)

### 3. Data Model Changes

- Collaborate with teams/ADR owners to establish:
  - Required changes at Inventory level  
  - Impact on APIs from these changes

## Summary of Current Requirements

- Provide scenario-based EIM API sets (full and subsets).
- Preserve APIs compatibility with Inventory.
- Maintain a single source of truth for API definitions.
- Deliver apiv2 that supports a particular EIM scenario based on the configuration provided at initialization time.
- Keep CLI operable against any scenario via discovery, caching, and command validation.
- Provide error handling for missing APIs per scenario.
- Support Helm-driven configuration (scenario selection).
- Support API selection per scenario through Mage/ArgoCD.

## Rationale

The approach aims to narrow the operational APIs surface to the specific scenarios being targeted,
while ensuring the full EMF remains available for deployments.
The proposed solution to APIs decomposition enables incremental decomposition that can be adopted
progressively without breaking existing integrations or workflows.

## Investigation Needed

The following investigation tasks will drive validation of the decomposition approach:

1. Validate feasibility of splitting services.proto and generating per-scenario specs via buf/protoc-gen-connect-openapi. (dropped)
2. Evaluate Inventory data model variations per scenario.
3. Verify impact of **1** and **2** on gRPC gateway generation and handler registration per scenario (buf code generation).
4. Validate Argo CD application configs or Mage targets for scenario-specific deployments.

## Implementation Plan for Orch CLI

1. Add login-time scenario discovery: retrieve scenario supporetd APIs from the new service.
2. Cache discovered capabilities in orch-cli config.
3. Validate user commands against supported APIs
4. Implement error handling for unsupported APIs.
5. Adjust help to hide unsupported commands/options.
6. Define E2E tests targeting all scenarios.

## Implementation Plan for EIM API

1. Restructure Proto Files. Split monolithic `services.proto` into service-scoped folders (dropped)
2. Create Scenario Manifests
3. Implement Manifests Parsing
4. Update Makefile  - target 'generate' to include manifest parsing into go mapping
5. Modify apiv2 proxy and server implementation to registere API service handlers per chosen scenario.
5. Update apiv2 Helm chart to take additional value to select the EIM scenario
5. ArgoCD Integration - update/provide profiles for known scenarios.

## Test plan

Tests will verify that minimal and full deployments work as expected, that clients can discover
supported features, and that errors are clear.

- CLI integration with new service: CLI can discover supported services, absence returns descriptive messages.
- CLI E2E: Login discovery, caching, command blocking, error messaging.
- Deployment E2E: Deploy each scenario via mage and verify that expected endpoints exist and work.
- Regression: Verify the full EMF scenario behaves identically to pre-decomposition.

## Open Issues

- Q: Traefik gateway removal and impacts. A: No impact on the API decomposition tasks
- Q: What happens when the service does not exist and CLI expects it to exist? A: CLI displays an error

- Q: How will managing apiv2 image version used by infra-core argo application look on the deployment level? A: One docker image covers all scenarios
- Q: Scenario deployment through ArgoCD
- Q: What will be the image naming convention (per scenario)? A: No change - one docker image covers all scenarios
