## Abstract

The Edge Microvisor Toolkit Standalone (EMT-S) node is designed to enable enterprise customers and developers to evaluate Intel silicon-based platforms for Edge AI use cases. In this context, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OXMs) play a critical role by preparing edge nodes in bulk for end customers at their facilities before shipping them to the deployment locations. To support the OXM workflow for Edge AI use cases, it is essential to implement a scalable provisioning solution for multiple EMT-S nodes. This document outlines the design proposal for enabling large-scale provisioning of EMT-S edge nodes to meet the requirements of the OXM workflow.
