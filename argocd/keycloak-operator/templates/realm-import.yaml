# Keycloak Realm Import CRD - DISABLED
# NOTE: KeycloakRealmImport CRD has issues with client creation in v26.4.2 Operator
# The realm configuration and clients are now applied via keycloak-config-cli job instead
# See: keycloak-config-cli-job.yaml
#
# Previous issues:
# - CRD marked as "Done" but clients were not created in Keycloak
# - Keycloak logs showed "client_not_found" errors
# - No error reported despite complete failure
#
# keycloak-config-cli job is more reliable and follows the pattern used in Bitnami Keycloak
# It supports variable substitution for dynamic cluster-specific URLs
