# Includes Edge Infrastructure Manager and UI

# This enables Edge Infrastructure Manager to support 1k edge nodes.
# It keeps default profiles for most charts: 128Mi/100m and 256Mi/200m.
# Based on Edge Infrastructure Manager scale tests, increases the resources for:
# host-manager, telemetry-manager, inventory.
