# Dependabot is used to manage dependencies in this repository. It is configured to automatically open pull requests to
# update dependencies when new versions are available. The following files are managed by Dependabot and do not require
# manual review or approval for changes. However, if you want to review the changes made by Dependabot, you can do so
# by checking the pull requests it opens. This workaround was shared in
# https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/23064#discussioncomment-8383923 and can be removed once GitHub properly
# supports CODEOWNERS for GitHub apps.
